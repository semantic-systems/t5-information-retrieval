Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a \ncommercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to \nothers in that category at year end.  \n\n Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.  \nHunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.\n\n Let me know if there are any issues.\n\nPhillip",

Counsel is seeking MTM calculations on these Terminated contracts/counteparties as soon as possible.  Accordingly, while on-going settlement discussions should continue, the focus for seconds/analysts should shift to calculating the MTM's (some of which are already underway per the Priority Settlements list) from the Terminated Contracts list.  We are currently seeking input from Counsel as to whether we should shift even more resources to the Terminated Contracts list MTM calculations.  We'll let you know on that.\n\nIn any case, I'm going to be collecting MTMs on the Priority Settlements when I do my daily rounds - I've been getting this from most of you but there's been some exceptions, so if you have the models done I'll be asking for:\n- Your calculated MTM number\n- The TAGG / NPower MTM number\nThanks in advance.\n\nAny questions or problems, let me know.\n\nRegards,\nMike\n\n ",

Jarda reports to \nEdward \"Ed\" Steadman, Associate Director for Research at the EERC. Norm \nMoreno with the POEP had contacted Ed, provided him with my name and number, \nand asked if Ed's organization would contact us in regard to the EERC \nproviding some assistance to TW with remediation of PCB contamination at the \nLaguna site. \n\nI provided a brief description of site conditions and we then discussed \nalternative remediation methods. Based on the information I provided, Jarda \nagreed that continued monitoring seemed to be appropriate. Jarda also \nindicated that his group did not have any off-the-shelf type remediation \ntechnologies that would be applicable. I suggested to Jarda that his \norganization might still be of service to TW in our discussions with the \nPueblo and the POEP as a third party opinion. Jarda said that he would \ndiscuss this with Ed and get back to me.",

One approach is through customer relationship marketing (CRM), where we will seek opportunities that allow our commercial teams to directly interact with important CXOs and existing customers. \n\nTo this end, we are proud to announce our participation in the Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which will be open to the public from May 18 through August 31.  Frank Gehry is a world-renowned architect who has designed the unique building at the end of our \"Ode to Why\" commercial and his art dominates skylines around the world. With this exhibition, Gehry's evolving genius comes to life.  For years, his inspiration has long been hidden in sketches and models unseen by anyone but his closest collaborators. By challenging the conventional, he has redefined his industry just as Enron has in business. Through Enron's association with this world-class exhibit, we will subtly push our brand attributes forward, as we strive to be the \"Leading Company in the World.\"\n\nAll employees are invited to visit this exhibition FREE OF CHARGE with an Enron ID Badge beginning May 18.

The settlement includes the netting and trading of imbalances, intraday recalls on released capacity, and other GISB mandates that took years to implement but in reality have no application to the industry.\nLiquidity has increased on the system, TTT volumes have increased from 3 Bcf/d to 5 Bcf/d over the last year with a 5:1 ration of physical to traded volumes. \nThe interconnect with Empire @ Lysander currently flowing 30-60,000dt/d has a maximum capability of 100,000dt/d.  Empire is now allowing secondary deliveries to Lysander therefore volumes have increased at the location.  Note:  Empire recently bought out by Union from ANR.\nDTI have an new pipeline project called Green brier.  A new company will be started that will consist of DTI as part owners and operators and other equity interests.  The new pipeline will flow 600,000 dt/d from Cornwell (interconnect with Tennessee and DTI) and run down through VA, into Granville County, NC.\nDTI are offering winter only (30cents) and summer only (13cents) service, the project is designed to compete with Transco's Momentum expansion into Zn4.  \nDTI have remarketed all the 55 Bcf of GSS that was turned back over the past year and also reconstructed for 90% of the 2.2 Bcf/d of transport.\nAnother project they are looking to release to the market is an expansion of deliveries to Leidy in conjunction with Marketlink.\nDTI have a current transportation offering, Lebanon to Leidy capacity 29,100dt/d, for one year starting 11/1/01.  DTI are looking and will probably get max rates (approximately 30 cents).\nDTI will be increasing the transportation fuel rates from 2.28% to 2.78% as per a TCRA settlement recently agreed to by it's customers.  The net effect of this will be a small reduction in the delivered quantity at the delivery locations and a small amount of stranded receipt point capacity on peak days.  This news has not been released to the market, I'm not sure when this will take effect. ",

Joe Hirl has assumed a leading \nrole in the formation of our business in Japan.  Joe also has regional \nresponsibility for trading activity.\n\nPaul's appointment is in recognition of the critical role Paul has played in \nEnron Australia's successful commencement and the body of outstanding work he \nhas accumulated to date in his career with Enron. It is worth noting that \nPaul joined Enron as recently as the Associate intake of 1995.  In the short \ntime since then Paul has developed and grown through various positions to his \ncurrent Trading and Origination role, a position of great responsibility in a \ndynamic young business making aggressive inroads into the Australian market, \nand far from Enron's traditional US markets. \n\nPlease join me in congratulating Paul on his appointment. \n\nRebecca",

He is doing research \non the deregulation of the Japanese power market.  We had lunch together and \nchatted for some time about his work (I worked in a Japanese company for 8 \n1/2 years and speak fluent Japanese, so we got along easily).\n\nHe was in Houston this week and came by to visit.  On Monday, we met with \nVince Kaminski and Grant Masson and later had dinner with them.  Sally \nsuggested that I introduce him to Alan Aronowitz and you.  Of course, you \nwere out of town, but we did meet with Alan who said you would probably want \nto meet him back in Tokyo anyway.\n\nWould you like for me to set something up?\n\nRegards,\n\n\n\nEugenio",

The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.\n\nFirst, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.\n\nThe Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.\n\nSteve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  \n\nAs you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.\n\nIn addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.\n\nWe will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.\n\nThank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.\n\nLink to the press release: http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2002/ene/012902Release.html\n",

The items marked in yellow are ones Jill is requesting your services, mainly to see if we can get transport and keep our bid competitive.  Please review and we can talk sometime tomorrow as I have meetings all afternoon today.  If you have a chance to start working this today and have some questions, just call Jill, Jennifer or Santiago.\n\nThanks,\n\nEric\n\n\n ",
