[preprocess_data.py](preprocess_data.py) is used to combine answers for similar questions into one question object 
instead of using multiples and for removing new lines from the data. The preprocessing step is not absolutely necessary.
The files takes a train_output.json and valid_output.json as the input. Those files should contain the annotated data in
SQuAD format.
