Joe Hirl has assumed a leading \nrole in the formation of our business in Japan.  Joe also has regional \nresponsibility for trading activity.\n\nPaul's appointment is in recognition of the critical role Paul has played in \nEnron Australia's successful commencement and the body of outstanding work he \nhas accumulated to date in his career with Enron. It is worth noting that \nPaul joined Enron as recently as the Associate intake of 1995.  In the short \ntime since then Paul has developed and grown through various positions to his \ncurrent Trading and Origination role, a position of great responsibility in a \ndynamic young business making aggressive inroads into the Australian market, \nand far from Enron's traditional US markets. \n\nPlease join me in congratulating Paul on his appointment. \n\nRebecca",

(AC Romero in Cassandra Schultz's office is co-ordinating my \nschedule). Carol Howes and I are meeting with Harry Bucalo on tuesday to look \nat weather settlements issues so we can also address the related control \nissues for this new product if that is convenient. \n\nThanks\n\nHeidi",

I was wondering if we could discuss what type of plans you have for \na mid and back office function.  I'd like to get in the loop and help set \ncontrols and procedures up as soon as possible.

He is doing research \non the deregulation of the Japanese power market.  We had lunch together and \nchatted for some time about his work (I worked in a Japanese company for 8 \n1/2 years and speak fluent Japanese, so we got along easily).\n\nHe was in Houston this week and came by to visit.  On Monday, we met with \nVince Kaminski and Grant Masson and later had dinner with them.  Sally \nsuggested that I introduce him to Alan Aronowitz and you.  Of course, you \nwere out of town, but we did meet with Alan who said you would probably want \nto meet him back in Tokyo anyway.\n\nWould you like for me to set something up?\n\nRegards,\n\n\n\nEugenio",

The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.\n\nFirst, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.\n\nThe Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.\n\nSteve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  \n\nAs you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.\n\nIn addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.\n\nWe will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.\n\nThank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.\n\nLink to the press release: http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2002/ene/012902Release.html\n",
